# MARL eVTOL Vertiport Scheduling - Prototype

**Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Safe eVTOL Vertiport Landing Scheduling**

Week 1-2 Deliverable: Core Environment + Baseline Schedulers

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning system for optimizing eVTOL (electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft landing scheduling at urban vertiports. The system addresses the critical bottleneck in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) networks where limited landing pads (4-16 per facility) must serve high volumes of aircraft while maintaining strict safety constraints.

### Key Objectives
- **Reduce landing delays** from 15-45 min (FCFS) to <5 min target
- **Improve throughput** by 25-35% over baseline methods
- **Maintain safety** through hard constraint enforcement
- **Optimize multi-objective** tradeoffs (delay, energy, safety)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### State Space (per aircraft)
```
Observation (35D for 8 pads):
├── Own state (7D)
│   ├── Position (x, y, altitude) - normalized
│   ├── Velocity, heading
│   ├── Battery SoC (%)
│   └── Passenger priority (1-5)
├── Pad states (24D = 8 pads × 3 features)
│   ├── Available (0/1)
│   ├── Cooldown remaining
│   └── Distance to pad
└── Airspace density (4D)
    └── Aircraft count per altitude ring
```

### Action Space
```
Actions (9 discrete):
├── 0-7: Land on pad 0-7
└── 8: Hold at current altitude
```

### Reward Structure
```python
reward = throughput_bonus          # +100 for successful landing
       + delay_penalty             # -2 × delay_minutes
       + battery_priority_bonus    # +50 if battery < 20%
       + passenger_priority_bonus  # +5 × priority_level
       + energy_penalty            # -0.1 × hold_energy
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Baseline Performance (20 aircraft/hour)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Environment Features

**Aircraft Heterogeneity:**
- 3 types: Light (25 min), Medium (40 min), Heavy (60 min) endurance
- Battery state: 10-90% SoC, with 15% critical (<20%)
- Passenger priority: 1-5 scale (higher = more urgent)

**Safety Constraints:**
- 500m horizontal separation zones around each pad
- Action masking prevents invalid actions (occupied pads, collisions)
- Pad cooldown: 3-5 min between departures

**Demand Modeling:**
- Poisson arrival process (λ = 5-50 aircraft/hour)
- Configurable density for curriculum learning

**Vertiport Configuration:**
- 8 TLOF (Touchdown and Lift-Off) pads
- 2×4 grid layout, 150m spacing
- Approach altitude rings: 1500m, 1000m, 500m

### Baseline Algorithms

**FCFS (First-Come-First-Served):**
```python
1. Sort aircraft by arrival time
2. Prioritize critical battery (<20%)
3. Assign first available pad in order
4. Hold if no pad available
```

**Greedy Heuristic:**
```python
priority_score = battery_urgency × 100
               + passenger_priority × 10  
               - distance_to_nearest_pad

1. Calculate priority for all aircraft
2. Sort by priority (descending)
3. Assign to nearest available pad
4. Hold if no valid assignment
```

## 💡 Design Highlights

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Graph-Based State**: Natural representation for vertiport topology
   - Pads as nodes, separation as edges
   - Enables GCN integration in Week 5-6

2. **Action Masking**: Safety-first approach
   - Hard constraints prevent invalid actions
   - No learning from unsafe experiences needed

3. **Curriculum Ready**: Scalable from 10→50 arrivals/hour
   - Environment parameterized by arrival_rate
   - Baseline tested at multiple densities

4. **Multi-Objective**: Real-world tradeoffs
   - Not just throughput - also safety, energy, passenger experience
   - Reward components can be reweighted

5. **Modular Design**: Easy to extend
   - Schedulers inherit from base class
   - Environment agnostic to scheduler type
   - Visualization decoupled from training

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **No wind dynamics yet** - Will add in Week 7 robustness testing
2. **Simplified kinematics** - Constant velocity, no complex flight dynamics  
3. **Perfect information** - Full observability (will add partial obs later)
4. **No communication delays** - Added in perturbation testing
5. **Deterministic separation** - Future: probabilistic collision modeling

These are intentional simplifications for the prototype phase and will be addressed in subsequent weeks.
